# Watopoly
Watopoly is a console-based Monopoly based game that takes a "University of Waterloo" twist. Think, geese!

Please get in touch with me to receive a compiled version of this game.

This game was implemented as a part of CS246 — "Object-Oriented Software Development" course taken during Winter 2022 at the University of Waterloo.
